Graphics Pipeline: URP (Universal Render Pipeline)
Programming Language: C#
VR SDKs: OpenXR, AR Foundation
Other Tools: Blender (for 3D modeling of assets)

## Installation and Setup:
This was developed and tested on MetaQuest 2. It has not been tested on any other VR headsets.
1. Clone the repository
2. Launch the project in Unity (Version 2023.2.20f1 Recommended)
3. Make sure you have the correct scene selected. You will be able to see the music store.
4. Connect your MetaQuest 2
5. You may build and run the project directly unto MetaQuest 2 or use Meta Link to be able to play it directly with Unity

## How to Play:
- Use the Left Controller's joystick to move around the area
- Use the Right Controller's joystick to turn around the area.
- Use the Right Controller's grip button to interact with objects in the area.

## Important Notes
- The only interactable objects in this early version of the project are the JUKEBOX, RECORD PLAYER, and BOOMBOX

## Troubleshooting:
